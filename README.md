* Ruby on Rails - `gem install rails` - Rails is a Ruby extension, so this is after installing Ruby.

application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
